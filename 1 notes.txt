*************************************************************************************************************************

What is web? 

===>The World Wide Web is a computer system which links documents and pictures into a database that is stored in computers in many different parts of the world and that people everywhere can also used "Front end & Back end" use.
//is used to Data transfer

===>www was the first web to be invented by Tim Berners Lee.

===>www stands for World Wide Web.

*************************************************************************************************************************

2.How Server Looks At Your URL

===>URL stands for   ****Uniform****    ****Resource****      ****Locator****
                          unique             Website               locator
                        
unique--->There can also used "Front end & Back end" be only one instagram.in 
resource->Inside this will be text,images,buttons.
locator-->IP address.

===>Back process in web:

www.instagram.in என்று கொடுத்தவுடன் 
//ISP ஆனது அந்த www.instagram.in link ஐ எடுத்து சென்று 
//DNS உதவியுடன் IP address ஐ கண்டுபிடித்து Request கொடுக்கும்.
பிறகு நாம் தேடிய IP address உடைய computer க்கு map செய்து விடும்.
//Server computer ல் இருந்து Home Page என்ற response வருகிறது.
இந்த செயல்கள் அனைத்துமே ISP உள் தான் நடைபெறுகிறது.

===>ISP stands for Internet Service Provider (Airtel,jio,BSNL என்கிற Internets)

===>DNS stands for Domain Name System (DNS work for find the Website Domaine Name & Find the Website Domaine Name க்கு உண்டான IP address )

===>IP stands for Internet Protocol (separate ip address ஒவ்வொரு website or webpage க்கும் தனித்தனி ip address உண்டு)

*************************************************************************************************************************

3.Intro to IP address, MAC address, Port Number

What is IP address?

===>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique numerical identifier for every device or network that connects to the internet.

===>ISP stands for Internet Service Provider (Airtel,jio,BSNL என்கிற Internets).
    
===>Practice: What is my mobile IP address 223.228.189.102(Airtel).

===>One popular way to get a client's IP address in JavaScript is to use a third-party API.
    There are many APIs available that provide this information, such as ipify and ipapi. 
 
===>API stands for Application Programming Interface

                ***************************************************************** 

What is MAC address?

===>A MAC address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device connected to the network.

===>MAC stands Media Access Control Address.

===>Each device has a unique address which is the MAC address.
//Every device will be separately different different address.So it is called MAC address.
//​ஒவ்வொரு deviceக்கும் தனித்தனி address இருக்கும்.அதுவே MAC address ஆகும்.

===>Every device that can also used "Front end & Back end" access the internet has a unique MAC address.They will give it in hardware while manufacturing it.
​//Every deviceக்கும்தனித்தனி mac address இருக்கும்.
//​அதை manufacture பண்ணும் போதே Hardware ல் கொடுத்து விடுவார்கள்.

===>Mac address is used when working only for particular device.
​//particular deviceக்கு மட்டும் work பண்ணும் போது mac address பயன்படுகிறது.

                ***************************************************************** 


what is Port Number?

===>A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.

===>Example:

city--->street--->door no
*more than many cities within one state.
*more than many streets within one city.
*more than many house within one street.
***but the door is separate *** ===> Since this is called Port.

===>Every Port will be separate number.So it is called "PORT NUMBER". 

*************************************************************************************************************************

4.HTTP Vs HTTPS 

what is HTTP?

===>client computer and server computer both talking is called "HTTP".

===>It has some set of rules.

===>It is a safe zone so data/information does not leak.

===>HTTP is of two types:
    *HTTP
    *HTTPS 

                ***************************************************************** 


Difference betwee HTTP vs HTTPS:

===>HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

===>Transfer means--->data/information passing.
===>Protocol means--->set of rules.

===>HTTP works at the application layer.

===>default port number:80

===>No encryption.

What is HTTPS:

===>HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure.

===>HTTPS works at the transport layer.

===>default port number:443

===>Both encryption and decryption.

===>Most Secured.can also used "Front end & Back end"not be hacked.


                ***************************************************************** 


HTTP Evalution:

1.HTTP 1.0(simple)===>client computer and server computer boths are just talking.

2.HTTP 1.1(Reuse) ===>client computer and server computer boths are just talking.
                  ===>limited datas are send and received.
                  ===>The datas are stored in cache(temprorialy storage area).

3.HTTP 2(concurrency)==>It's works multi tasking.
                     ==>Many Request&Response send &received.
                     ==>Example:WhatsApp(30 photos send and received)
                     ==>Example:Zoom call.

HTTP Basic Methods:
                           Example:Instagram and Facebook

1.GET(Read)========>We create the post.

2.POST(Create)=====>We create the comment.

3.PUT(Update)======>We create the edit.

4.DELETE(Delete)===>Deleted the post and comments.

*************************************************************************************************************************

5.Intro to Browser internals(HTML parser, CSS parser) 

What is parser:

===>பாகுபடுத்தி காட்டுதல்.

===>parses the code, build AST, scope variables and find errors.

===>part of compiler.

===>Allign farming(Example:Mobile Reboot)


                ***************************************************************** 

What is HTML parser/DOM:

===>HTML parsing is the process of taking raw HTML code, 
===>reading it,
===>and generating a DOM tree object structure from it.

===>Remember:Skeleton

===>DOM--->Document Object Model


                ***************************************************************** 

What is CSS parser/CSSOM tree:

===>takes the bytes and converts them into characters, 
===>then tokens, 
===>then nodes and finally they are linked into the CSSOM.
===>CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
===>CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheet Object Model.

===>Remember:Style Dress


                ***************************************************************** 

5.1 JavaScript V8 engine internals:

===>JavaScript defines Functionality/Activity.

===>Our eyes don't know.

===>System or computer understand only boolean language (0,1).So it needs JS.

===>Examples:Calculator Application

===>Browser   Chrome       Firebox          InternetExplore  
===>Engines    V8        SpiderMonkey           Chakra          


===>JS originally only Front end was used.The browser worked well with the java engine.So the Back end is used.

===>Chrome is the browser's helps or selected V8 javaengine.

===>V8 has a built-in Garbage Collector (GC).

===>V8:More giving additional features.

===>***This is called node.js***

===>It can also used "Front end & Back end".

===>V8 faster than 3.5 times in JAVA.

===>***Archi JS Engine is first discoved JS Engine***. 

*************************************************************************************************************************

6.Browser js vs Node js

what is browser js?

===>Client side code executer.

===>Front End(React)

===>In-browser JavaScript can also used "Front end & Back end" do everything related to 
    
===>webpage manipulation, 

===>interaction with the user, and the webserver. 

===>For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to: 

• Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.

                ***************************************************************** 

what is node js?

===>Server side code executer.

===>Back End


===>Node.js is an open source server environment.

*************************************************************************************************************************

7.HTML Browser view - Debugger, Inspect

===>Inspect:
            index.html---->Go Live or Open with Live server---->Hi🙌 Kindly see 👀the console for results😍 
            ---->Right click---->Inspect---->Style---->Change the background color,Font size and etc.,  

===>Debuggers:

*Built-in debuggers can also used "Front end & Back end" be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user. 

*With a debugger,you can also used "Front end & Back end" also set breakpoints (places where code execution can also used "Front end & Back end" be stopped), 

*and examine variables while the code is executing.

*************************************************************************************************************************

8.using fror HTML,CSS,JS:

===>HTML used to ***Create a page,label,button,grid***

===>CSS used to ***Look and feel, Spelling mistake,Colors and Styles***

===>JS used to ***Functionality/Activity
